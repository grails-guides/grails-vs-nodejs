Run the server application as follows:

[source,bash]
----
~ ./gradlew server:bootRun
Grails application running at http://localhost:8443 in environment: development
----

Run the client side application (with HTTPS enabled) as follows:

[source,bash]
----
~ export HTTPS = true
~ ./gradlew client:bootRun
Starting the development server...

Compiled successfully!

The app is running at:

  https://localhost:3000/
----

You should be able to browser to `https://localhost:3000`, create a new
user, and login. Try out the app! Add/remove some flavors to your user
account. After one minute, your user session will end and you’ll be
logged out (you can change this duration in the Grails’ app’s
`application.yml` file). If you open multiple browsers and login with
different users at different times, each user will be logged out
separately only when their own session expires.

Congratulations! You’ve got the Ice Cream app running with a Grails
backend.
