Because Grails is based upon Spring Boot, it is compatible with many
other projects in the Spring Ecosystem. One of the most popular such
projects is https://projects.spring.io/spring-security/[Spring
Security]. It provides powerful authentication and access control for
Java web apps, and supports many authentication methods, from LDAP to
OAuth2. Even better, there is a set of
http://plugins.grails.org/plugin/grails/spring-security-core[Grails
plugins] that make Spring Security a breeze to set up.

Edit `server/build.gradle` again, and add the following two lines:
`server/build.gradle`

[source, groovy]
./server/build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/build.gradle[indent=0,tag=securityDependency]
----

We have placed the Spring Security Core and REST plugins configuration in `application.yml`

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.yml[tag=springsecurity]
----

Please consult the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/3.0.x/reference/security-filter-chain.html[Spring
Security docs] and the
http://grails-plugins.github.io/grails-spring-security-core/3.2.x/index.html[Grails
Spring Security plugin] docs for more information.

We have modified slightly the `User` domain class. Moreover, we added two other domain classes to map roles and the relationship 
between roles and users. 

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/domain/demo/User.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/demo/User.groovy[]
----

<1> We'll use this property to keep track of expired sessions

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/domain/demo/Role.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/demo/Role.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/domain/demo/UserRole.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/demo/UserRole.groovy[]
----

We have added a “listener” which will encrypt our `password` field whenever a new `User` is created.

[source, groovy]
./server/src/main/groovy/demo/UserPasswordEncoderListener.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/src/main/groovy/demo/UserPasswordEncoderListener.groovy[]
----

We register this listener as a Bean in `resources.groovy`

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
----
import demo.UserPasswordEncoderListener

// Place your Spring DSL code here
beans = {
    userPasswordEncoderListener(UserPasswordEncoderListener) 
}
----
