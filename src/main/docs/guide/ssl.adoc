We can follow the commands from the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[previous “Web App” article] to
generate our self-signed SSL certificate:

[source,bash]
----
~ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
----

However, we have one more step to use our SSL certificate with Grails.
Grails (and Spring Boot) doesn’t support the PEM format. Instead, we
need to use the PKCS12 format for our keys. Fortunately, there is a
single `openssl` command to make the conversion:

[source,bash]
----
~ openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey key.pem -out keystore.p12 -name tomcat -caname root
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
When deploying to a server like Tomcat, it is necessary to use the Java KeyStore (`.jks`) format for SSL certificates. See the following links for information on the conversion and configuration of JKS:

<li><a href="https://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/deployment.html#deploymentTasks">Configure JKS with Grails (docs)</a></li>
</ul>
++++

====

To configure Grails to use our SSL certification, update the
`application.yml` config file with the following lines:

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0,tag=ssl]
----

TIP: In Java apps it is more typical to use port 8443 for HTTPS
traffic, which eliminates the need to use `sudo` to run the server.
