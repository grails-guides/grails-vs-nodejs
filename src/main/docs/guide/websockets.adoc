Our final server-side feature is to push “session timeout” events to the
client over a websocket connection. We’ll use another Grails plugin, the
https://plugins.grails.org/plugin/zyro/grails-spring-websocket[Spring
Websocket plugin], to support this feature.

Install the plugin by adding another line to our `build.gradle` file:

[source, groovy]
./server/build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/build.gradle[indent=0,tag=websocketDependency]
----

We now have to implement three classes to get our web socket session
timeout working:

1.  A configuration class to configure our websocket connection
2.  A “listener” class to keep track of when new authentication tokens
are created
3.  A “scheduler” class to periodically check for “expired” sessions and
push events over the websocket connection.

Because these classes are not Grails-specific, we will create them as
Groovy classes under `server/src/main/groovy`.

Here is the complete code for these three classes:

[source, groovy]
./server/src/main/groovy/demo/CustomWebSocketConfig.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/src/main/groovy/demo/CustomWebSocketConfig.groovy[]
----
<1> Loads our `allowedOrigin` config property from application.yml
<2> Configures the websocket connection to accept requests from our client server

[source, groovy]
./server/src/main/groovy/demo/TokenCreationEventListener.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/src/main/groovy/demo/TokenCreationEventListener.groovy[]
----
<1> We are extending a `ApplicationListener` interface, which is part of the Spring Framework and allows us to "listen" to specific application events. In this case, we are listening for `RestTokenCreationEvent`. You can find other events to listen for in the http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/#_events[Spring Security REST plugin documentation].
<2> The `withTransaction` method is needed here because our custom class doesn't have access to GORM by default (unlike controllers and services). The `User` domain class is not actually important - we could use any domain class here. `withNewSession` will initiate a GORM/Hibernate transaction and allow us to query the database and persist changes. See the http://gorm.grails.org/6.1.x/hibernate/manual/index.html#persistenceBasics[GORM documentation for more details.]

[source, groovy]
./server/src/main/groovy/demo/SessionExpirationJobHolder.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/src/main/groovy/demo/SessionExpirationJobHolder.groovy[]
----
<1> This class is provided by the spring-websocket plugin and allows us to push an event over a websocket channel
<2> Loads our timeout.minutes property from application.yml
<3> Run method every minute
<4> Use Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/time/TimeCategory.html[`TimeCategory`] DSL for time operations
<5> Send a websocket message to a user-specific "channel" for each expired user - we're using their username as the unique key for each channel

With these classes in place, we need to plug them into the Spring
context by adding them as “beans” in our `resources.groovy` file. Edit
the file as shown below.

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/spring/resources.groovy[]
----
<1> Register the password encoder listener
<2> Custom settings for websockets
<3> Listens for new access tokens and sets the loginDate
<4> Checks for expired sessions


Next, in order for our scheduled `SessionExpirationJobHolder` class to
actually fire as scheduled, we have to enable scheduling in our
application (it’s not on by default). We do that by editing our app’s
`Application.groovy` file (note the capitalization!).

[source, groovy]
./server/grails-app/init/demo/Application.groovy
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/init/demo/Application.groovy[]
----

And finally, you may remember we referenced a couple of new config
properties in the classes above. Let’s add those to our
`application.yml` file (add the lines below to the end of the file).

[source, yml]
./server/grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0,tag=allowedOrigin]
----

TIP: Grails applications can read config values set in a variety of
ways, including YAML files, Groovy files, and system properties. See the
http://docs.grails.org/latest/guide/conf.html[Grails documentation] for
more on how to use configuration files.

That’s all for the Grails backend server - we have support for CORS (out
of the box), websockets, authentication, RESTful web services, 
scheduled methods, and persistence to PostgresSQL.
