 "Grails is a powerful web framework, for the Java platform aimed at multiplying developersâ€™ productivity."

Web frameworks provide an array of features which hopefully make
developers lives easier when building web applications. Sometimes
however, web frameworks get in the way or force developers to write
boilerplate or framework-specific code that's not relevant to the
business need of the app. Understandably, many developers are wary of
"yet another web framework" and of the hidden costs that using one might
incur.

In the case of web applications, Grails is truly different. The Grails
framework goes the extra mile by providing developers with a set of
sensible, but customizable, defaults, encouraging a "convention over
configuration" approach to development, while providing a powerful set
of tools that make developing data-driven web apps fun again.

TIP: Grails 3.x is based on the Spring Boot framework, but includes substantial features and improvements to the developer's experience over a "plain" Spring Boot project. See https://objectcomputing.com/news/2017/06/28/grails-vs-spring-boot[this article for more on the differences between Grails & Spring Boot].

Much of Grails' "magic" comes from its use of the Groovy programming
language. From the http://www.groovy-lang.org[official website], Groovy
is a "powerful, optionally typed and dynamic language, with
static-typing and static compilation capabilities, for the Java
platform." Grails apps can be written using Java, however Groovy's
flexibility and developer-friendly features can make your code much more
expressive and readable. If you are familiar at all with Java syntax,
you will be able to read (and write) Groovy code. All of our server-side
code in this article will be written in Groovy.
