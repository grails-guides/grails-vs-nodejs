Deployment is a big topic on its own and one that we won’t cover
in-depth. As with many Java web apps, our Grails backend can be deployed
to any JEE container as a WAR file (this will require some additional
configuration), or more cleanly as a self-contained JAR file (which
doesn’t require a separate server to run).

Our React app can be built just like any `create-react-app` project
using `npm run build` (or `yarn build`), and deployed to a standard web
server. Obviously attention must be given to making sure the React
client can reach the API backend (and the `SERVER_URL` variable may need
to be set accordingly).

An attractive way to package and deploy a Grails/React app is to bundle
both apps together into a single executable JAR file. This approach is
documented in tutorial form in the

React profile projects”] Grails Guide.
