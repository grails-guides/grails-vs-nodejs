Now we’re ready to turn to the client-side portion of our app. For this
step, we are going to be using the code found in the Github repo for the
https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[previous “Web App” article]. You can access the code here:
https://github.com/mvolkmann/ice-cream-app/tree/master/src

Download (or `git clone`) the source files at the URL above, and copy
them into the `client/src` directory (overwriting any existing files).

[source,bash]
----
~ cd ../
~ git clone https://github.com/mvolkmann/ice-cream-app tmp
~ cp -Rv tmp/* ice-cream/client/
----

This will make the `client` subproject identical to the Ice Cream app
from the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[previous article].

Now, let’s delete the files we don’t need.

[source,bash]
----
~ cd ice-cream/client
~ rm -rf database/ server/ css/ images/
----

This should leave you with the following directories under `client`:

[source,bash]
----
-rw-r--r--  LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  README.md
drwxr-xr-x  build
-rw-r--r--  build.gradle
drwxr-xr-x  node_modules
-rw-r--r--  package.json
drwxr-xr-x  public
drwxr-xr-x  src
-rw-r--r--  yarn.lock
----

And the following files under `client/src`:

[source,bash]
----
-rw-r--r--  App.css
-rw-r--r--  App.js
-rw-r--r--  App.test.js
-rw-r--r--  config.js
-rw-r--r--  ice-cream-entry.js
-rw-r--r--  ice-cream-list.js
-rw-r--r--  ice-cream-row.js
-rw-r--r--  index.css
-rw-r--r--  index.js
-rw-r--r--  login.js
-rw-r--r--  main.js
----

We only have to edit 2 of these `src` files, and update our
`package.json`, in order to hook up the React app with our new Grails
backend.

First, edit `client/package.json` as shown below:

[source, javascript]
./client/package.json
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/package.json[]
----

We’ve removed several packages that were needed by the Node Express
server, and we’ve replaced the `socket.io` package with `sockjs-client`
and `stompjs`, which is supported by the Spring Websockets library we’ve
configured previously (`socket.io` is designed for Node apps and is not
compatible with Spring Websockets).

We also need to edit the `config.js` file. This is provided by the React
profile for Grails and simply holds a few config variables, including a
`SERVER_URL` value which sets the API base URL. Edit the file as shown
below:

[source, javascript]
./client/src/config.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/config.js[]
----

Now we have to update two of the React components in our Ice Cream app,
`Login` and `App`.

Edit the `login.js` file as shown below (changes from the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[original
code] are marked with `//NEW:` comments).


[source, javascript]
./client/src/login.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/login.js[]
----

Finally, we can edit the `App.js` file to support our new websocket
channels, as well as our `SERVER_URL` config setting. Like above, all
changes relative to the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[original code] are marked with `NEW` comments.

[source, javascript]
./client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[]
----
