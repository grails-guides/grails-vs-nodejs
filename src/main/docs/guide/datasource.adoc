Now that we have our basic application structure, its’s time to set up
our database. We are trying to migrate a https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[REACT + Node/express application] which used PostgreSQL.
However, it’s worth noting that Grails has already set up a basic
datasource for us, in the form on an in-memory H2 database. This
database is destroyed and recreated every time the app is run, and it
will even be updated during runtime if new tables/columns are added to
the domain classes (more on those later). For many apps, this default
database will be very well suited for the initial stages of app
development, especially if you’re making many iterative changes to your
data model. However, in keeping with the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[app being migrated], we are going
to replace this default H2 datasource with our desired PostgreSQL database.

Let’s recap the steps to install PostgresSQL on your machine:

[quote, Web App, Step by Step -- Mark Volkmann]
____
To install PostgreSQL in Windows, see https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/.

To install PostgreSQL in macOS:

Install Homebrew by following the instructions at http://brew.sh/.
Enter the following: brew install postgresql
To start the database server, enter `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start`.

To stop the database server later, enter `pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres stop -m fast`.
____

Once you’ve installed Postgres (or if you already have it installed),
create a new database for our app using `createdb`

[source, bash]

~ createdb ice_cream_db_2

If you recall in the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[previous article] (where the above installation
steps were taken from), the next steps here would be to create the
database tables needed for our app. However, we won’t be using any SQL
in this project. That’s because Grails offers a powerful and
developer-friendly alternative: the http://gorm.grails.org/[GORM]; a data access toolkit for the JVM.
