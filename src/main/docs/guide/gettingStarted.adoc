We are going to use the React + Node.js application described by https://github.com/mvolkmann[Mark Volkmann] in the https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett[SETT] article https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[Web App Step by Step, April 2017 issue of SETT]. The article laid out a
detailed blueprint for developing a modern web application from beginning to end. The sample project in this article featured a React frontend and a Node/express.jsbackend, backed by PostgresSQL database. The project included several advanced features, including WebSockets and HTTPS.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to develop
the same web app, using the Grails framework. The only explicit
technology change we will be making will be the use of Grails over
Node/express.js for the backend - otherwise we will use the same stack,
including React and PostgresSQL. However, we will see how Grails
simplifies and accelerates the development process and makes developers
more productive without giving up finer grain control where needed.

The emphasis of this guide will not be so much learning how the
“innards” of how web applications work, but rather on _developer
productivity_. In addition, we will refer readers to the original SETT article for
details on the implementation of the React application, as there we will
be using almost the exact same code (any changes will be highlighted and
explained).

This guide shows how to transition an application from a technology stack such as:
