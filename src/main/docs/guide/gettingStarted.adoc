This guide shows how to transition an application from a technology stack such as:

to:

We are going to use the React + Node.js application described by https://github.com/mvolkmann[Mark Volkmann] in his post https://objectcomputing.com/resources/publications/sett/april-2017-web-app-step-by-step[Web App Step by Step, April 2017 issue of SETT]. In that post, he laid out a
detailed blueprint for developing a modern web application, from beginning to end. He used a front-end built in React and a backend built with Node/express which consumed a PostgresSQL database.

In this guide, we will demonstrate how to develop
the same web app, using the Grails framework. The only explicit
technology change we will be making will be the use of Grails over
Node/express for the backend - otherwise we will use the same stack,
including React and PostgresSQL. However, we will see how Grails
simplifies and accelerates the development process and makes developers
more productive without giving up finer grain control where needed.

The emphasis of this guide will not be so much learning how the
“innards” of how web applications work, but rather on _developer
productivity_. In addition, we will refer readers to Mark’s article for
details on the implementation of the React application, as there we will
be using almost the exact same code (any changes will be highlighted and
explained).
